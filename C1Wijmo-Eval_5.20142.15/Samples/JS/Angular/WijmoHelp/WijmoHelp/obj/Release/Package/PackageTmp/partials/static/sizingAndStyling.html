<h2>
    Sizing and Styling Controls</h2>
<p>
    Wijmo 5 controls rely on CSS for styling, appearance, and sizing.</p>
<p>
    Because of this, Wijmo 5 controls don't have properties such as "width," "height," or "background."
    Styling and layout is handled using CSS. If you are used to .NET controls, including
    <b>WinForms</b> and <b>XAML</b>, this may feel a little strange at first. But once you get used
    to using CSS, you will find that it is very easy and extremely powerful. You can easily style 
    all instances of a control type, or style a specific control, all with a few lines of 
    extremely re-usable CSS.</p>

<h3>
    Sizing Controls</h3>
<p>
    The size and position of the controls are determined by the hosting element, which follows
    the usual HTML/CSS rules. For example, the CSS rule below stipulates that elements with
    class "grid" should have their height calculated automatically to fit the grid content,
    up to a limit of 300 pixels:</p>
<pre>.grid {
    height: auto;
    max-height: 300px;
}</pre>
<p>
    The fiddle below shows how this rule affects two <b>FlexGrid</b> controls. The first grid
    has only a few items, so it is resized to fit its content (like a regular HTML table).
    The second grid has a lot contains a lot more items, so its height is limited to 300 
    pixels and it becomes scrollable.</p>

        Sizing Controls
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    The first grid has only five elements to show. Since that requires less than 300 pixels, the 
    grid shows all elements and doesn't need scrollbars. The second grid contains 10,000
    items. That exceeds 300 pixels, so the grid becomes scrollable.</p>

<h3>
    Styling Controls</h3>
<p>
    Control styling follows the same logic as sizing. Use CSS to override fonts, colors, 
    margins, padding, and pretty much any visual aspect of any part of the controls.</p>
<p>
    For example, this fiddle shows how you can modify the appearance of the
    <b>FlexGrid</b> control using CSS:</p>
<p>
    <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Wijmo5/3L8Cf/" target="_blank" class="btn btn-info">
        <img src="../../images/fiddle.png" />
        Styling Controls
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    Notice how now the grids now have a plain black and white look. To do this, we change 
    the CSS and specify the styles for elements <b>within</b> the grid.
    Wijmo controls assign class names to their constituent elements, which enables
    easy and flexible styling.</p>
<p>
    For example, the CSS below creates cell elements (elements with class "wj-cell" 
    contained in elements with class "grid") with no border and a white
    background:</p>
<pre>.grid .wj-cell {
    border: none;
    background-color: #fff;
}
</pre>
