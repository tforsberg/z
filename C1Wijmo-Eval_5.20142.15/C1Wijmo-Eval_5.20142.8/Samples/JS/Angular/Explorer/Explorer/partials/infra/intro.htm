            Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            This new version of Wijmo was re-written from scratch.
            We decided it was time to take full advantage of the latest technologies and
            launch a pure HTML5/JavaScript product, no longer making compromises in order
            to support legacy browsers.</p>
        <p>
            We also decided to leverage our experience in control development and
            implement some .NET tried-and-true concepts including the <b>ICollectionView</b>
            interface, event patterns, and control templates.</p>
        <p>
            This application highlights some of the main features in Wijmo 5. If you want
            to learn more about the details, feel free to check the
