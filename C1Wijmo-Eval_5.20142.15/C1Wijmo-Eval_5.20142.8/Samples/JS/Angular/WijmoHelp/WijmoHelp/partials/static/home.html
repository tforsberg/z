<h2>
    Welcome to Wijmo 5</h2>
<p>
    This new version of Wijmo was re-written from scratch. We decided it was time
    to launch an HTML5/JavaScript product that takes full advantage of the latest
    and greatest technologies without making compromises in order to 
    support legacy browsers.</p>
<p>
    Wijmo 5 requires Internet Explorer 9 or better to leverage the following technologies:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>ECMAScript 5:</b> The ECMAScript 5 standard adds support for 
        property getters and setters. This may seem like a small change, but
        it makes a huge difference. For example, instead of writing 
        <code>control.value(control.value() + 1)</code> to increment the 
        value of a property, now you can write <code>control.value++</code>. 
        The ECMAScript 5 standard adds many other significant enhancements, 
        like the 
        <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-apply-call-and-bind-methods-are-essential-for-javascript-professionals/" target="_blank">
            bind
        </a> method that allows you to specify the value of the 'this' 
        parameter in your callbacks. There are also new 
        <a href="https://www.inkling.com/read/javascript-definitive-guide-david-flanagan-6th/chapter-7/ecmascript-5-array-methods" target="_blank">
            array methods
        </a>
        that can save a lot of time.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>SVG:</b> Modern browsers implement 
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/SVG" target="_blank">SVG</a>, 
        which makes it easier to create amazing visual representations of your 
        data. Wijmo leverages SVG directly, without the overhead that would be
        required if it had to support legacy browsers.</li>
    <li>
        <b>AngularJS:</b> 
        <a href="http://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>
        is one of the most popular and powerful JavaScript application frameworks 
        today. We believe it will continue to gain popularity and will set the 
        direction of the next Web. For this reason, we ship and maintain AngularJS 
        directives for all of our controls, and use it in most of our samples. For 
        more information, see the <a href="angularDirectives.html">Using Wijmo 5 in 
        AngularJS Applications</a> topic.
        Of course, you can also use Wijmo with other frameworks, and we may add
        official support for them in the future if our customers require it.</li>
    <li>
        <b>Bootstrap:</b> 
        <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>
        is one of the easiest, most powerful, and most popular CSS frameworks 
        available. We use it in our samples and in our on-line documentation. 
        If you use Bootstrap, be assured that Wijmo 5 will blend right in 
        with no extra effort required on your part.</li>
    <li>
        <b>jQuery 2.0:</b>
        <a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2013/04/18/jquery-2-0-released/" target="_blank">
            jQuery
        </a>
        was one of the first popular JavaScript libraries to release a version 
        targeting modern browsers. Wijmo takes advantage of that as well, using 
        jQuery 2.0 and benefiting from its smaller size and better performance.</li>
    <li>
        <b>TypeScript:</b> We wrote Wijmo in 
        <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>, taking 
        advantage of type-checking and OOP concepts such as modules, classes, 
        and inheritance. The output is still pure JavaScript, so you can use 
        either language in your own development work.</li>
    <li>
        <b>Mobile Devices:</b> Wijmo 5 was designed with mobile browser
        support built in from the start. Responsive layouts and touch support 
        were major considerations in the design and implementation of every Wijmo 5
        control.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    We do realize that some scenarios require support for legacy browsers
    (Internet Explorer 8 and earlier). For that reason, we will continue to 
    maintain versions of the original Wijmo for as long as our customers 
    require it. If you need to support IE8 and earlier, keep using the original 
    Wijmo. We will maintain and support it as usual. If you are ready to move to
    HTML5 and modern browsers, Wijmo 5 is for you!</p>
