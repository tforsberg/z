Adaptive Widget Sample
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use the same widgets with either jQuery UI or jQuery Mobile

This application uses wijmo's single library that adapts to either jQuery Mobile or jQuery 
UI. When used with jQuery UI, wijmo behaves as desktop widgets. When used with jQuery Mobile, 
wijmo behaves as mobile widgets. 

The only requirement to begin mobile development is to change dependencies from jQuery UI to 
jQuery Mobile. When used with jQuery Mobile, wijmo also supports declarative markup. You can 
initialize widgets by adding data-role="widgetName" into the DOM element.
