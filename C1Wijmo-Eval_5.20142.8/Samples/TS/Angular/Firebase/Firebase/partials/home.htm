    This application is based on a Firebase version of the traditional Northwind database.</p>
<p>
    The database was created by loading the 
    <a href="http://services.odata.org/Northwind/Northwind.svc/">OData version of Northwind</a>
    and writing it to a set of Firebase tables.</p>
<p>
    The interesting thing about Firebase is that it supports real-time updates, so any changes
    you make to any of the grids in the application will be immediately applied to the database,
    and any other instances of the application currently running will show the changes 
    immediately.</p>
<p>
    You can try that out by clicking <a href="#" target="_blank">this link</a> to start a new 
    instance of the application and making some changes to the grids. If anyone else is running
    the sample anywhere, you will see their changes and they will see yours, in real-time.</p>
<p>
    The <b>FirebaseCollectionView</b> class in this sample extends the <b>CollectionView</b>
    class in Wijmo to connect to Firebase tables. <b>FirebaseCollectionView</b> loads data 
    from Firebase tables and allows users to edit, add, and remove items. When the data 
    changes, the Firebase tables are automatically updated.</p>
<p>
    Note that the grids have several data-mapped columns. For example, the orders grid shows
    the name of the employee rather than the ID. If you change an employee's name, the orders
    grid will be updated automatically.</p>
