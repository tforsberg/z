<h2>
    Globalizing Wijmo 5 Applications</h2>
<p>
    By default, Wijmo formats and parses data using the American English culture.
    The decimal symbol is a period, the thousands separator is a comma, and the 
    days of the week are "Sunday" through "Saturday.&quot;</p>
<p>
    If your application targets other cultures, include references to
    the appropriate Wijmo culture files in your HTML pages. We include about 10
    culture files with Wijmo, and have tools for generating new ones.
    If you want to target a culture that is not currently supported, contact
    us and we will create the file you need.</p>
<p>
    For example, to localize an application for the German culture, add this line to the head section of the page:</p>

<pre>&lt;!-- set German culture --&gt;
&lt;script src="http://cdn.wijmo.com/5.20142.0/controls/cultures/wijmo.culture.de.min.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<p>
    This fiddle demonstrates the result. Notice the formatting of grid values and calendar dates.</p>

        Globalization
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    You can edit the values in the grid to see that globalization also works for 
    parsing data. Wijmo's <a href="topic/wijmo.Globalize.Class.html">Globalize</a>
    class allows you to format and parse values in your applications outside of 
    Wijmo controls as well.</p>
