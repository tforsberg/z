<h2>
	What Is LESS?</h2>
<p>
	LESS is a dynamic style sheet language that extends CSS through the addition of variables, 
    mixins, operations and nested rules.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Variables:</b> Reusable common values, such as color and style information.</li>
	<li>
		<b>Mixins:</b> Properties from existing styles that you use inside new styles.</li>
	<li>
		<b>Operations:</b> Mathematical creation and manipulation of CSS properties.</li>
	<li>
		<b>Nested rules:</b> CSS selectors placed inside of other CSS selectors.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	LESS is also referred to as a CSS preprocessor because you can write style sheets in the 
    extended LESS language first, and then compile them into plain CSS. LESS is open-source 
    and you can run it on the client-side or server-side, or compile it and output it as 
    plain CSS.</p>
<p>
	For downloads, detailed documentation, and resources, see the LESS web site: 
    <a href="http://lesscss.org" target="_blank">http://lesscss.org</a>.</p>
<h2>
	Using LESS</h2>
<p>
	You can use LESS from the command line, download it as a JS file for in-browser use, 
    or use a third party application.</p>
<p>
	<b>Command line</b></p>
<p>
	You can find specific instructions and a list of command-line prompts on the LESS 
    web site under 
    <a href="http://lesscss.org/usage/#command-line-usage" target="_blank">Command Line Usage</a>.</p>
<p>
	<b>In-browser</b></p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Download a copy of <a href="http://lesscss.org/#download-options" target="_blank">less.js</a>
        and save it.</li>
	<li>
		Create a style sheet and save it using the .less file extension instead of the usual
        .css extension.</li>
	<li>
		Add the following code within the &lt;head&gt; element of your HTML page:</li>
</ol>

<pre>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet/less" type="text/css" href="styles.less"&gt;
&lt;script src="less.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>
	<b>Note:</b> In the link element, you must replace the typical rel="stylesheet" with 
    rel="stylesheet<b>/less</b>" in order for LESS to compile in the browser. LESS style 
    sheets must come before the LESS script.</p>
<p>
	When the page loads, <b>less.js</b> processes and compiles your LESS code live in the 
    browser. While this is a convenient way to start developing with LESS, it is not 
    recommended in production environments where performance is important.</p>
<p>
	<b>Third party applications</b></p>
<p>
	It is advisable to compile LESS into plain CSS for production environments. If you want
    something more than the command line prompts offer, a wide array of third party tools 
    is available. The LESS web site has a list of compilers and editors for various platforms 
    and IDEs. See
    <a href="http://lesscss.org/usage/index.html#online-less-compilers" target="_blank">Online LESS Compilers</a>.</p>
<h2>
	Customizing Variables</h2>
<p>
	We built Wijmo 5 themes with LESS and make the source files available along with their 
    compiled CSS counterparts. You can update existing themes and create new ones using the 
    provided files.</p>
<p>
	The Wijmo 5 themes have this file naming structure: wijmo.theme.<i>ThemeName</i>.css. 
    To update a theme using LESS, find the corresponding wijmo.theme.<i>ThemeName</i>.less 
    file, modify it, and re-compile it using one of the methods listed above.</p>
<p>
	Every theme is built upon a base set of colors and style options. We declare variables
    for these common values that we reuse throughout the theme. Note that LESS variables 
    start with the @ symbol.</p>
<pre>
@background: #f3f3f3;
@header: #54443b;
@primary: #2780ec;
@text: #26211f;
@button: #5f534c;
@tool-tip: #e5d9cf;
@grid-cell-border: true;
@grid-right-side-col: none;
@border-radius: 4px;
@background-grad: false;
@button-grad: false;
@header-grad: false;
</pre>
<p>
	In addition to base variables, we use import statements to include additional LESS files
    to use as mixins. These contain color functions, style mixins, and mixin guards.</p>
<pre>
@import "mixins/color-functions";
@import "mixins/guards";
@import "mixins/styles";
@import "mixins/chart";
</pre>
<p>
	The color functions generate a wider pallet of additional colors based on the initial 
    colors selected and the mixin guards are designed to ensure contrast. The mixin guards 
    evaluate colors based on their lightness and write CSS accordingly:  If an area's 
    background color is greater than 50% in lightness, the text in that area renders in 
    a darker color, and vice versa.</p>
<h3>
	Creating New Themes</h3>
<p>
	You can create new themes by duplicating an existing theme and then modifying the base
    set of colors and style options. Here is a key to the color and style variables.</p>
<p>
	<b>@background</b> - Background color for the control.<br />
	<b>@header</b> - Background color for control headers (e.g. FlexGrid, FlexChart).<br />
	<b>@primary</b> - Primary accent color used throughout the theme.<br />
	<b>@text</b> - Default text color.<br />
	<b>@button</b> - Background color for buttons.<br />
	<b>@tool-tip</b> - Background color for tooltips.<br />
	<b>@border-radius</b> - Global border radius setting for all controls.<br />
	<b>@grid-cell-border</b> - Toggle for FlexGrid cell borders. Set to 'false' to turn off all grid borders.<br />
	<b>@grid-right-side-col</b> - Background color for FlexGrid right side column (none by default).<br />
	<b>@background-grad</b> - Toggle for control background color gradient. Set to 'true' to add a gradient.<br />
	<b>@button-grad</b> - Toggle for button background color gradient. Set to 'true' to add a gradient.<br />
	<b>@header-grad</b> - Toggle for header background color gradient. Set to 'true' to add a gradient.</p>
<h3>
	Deploying New Themes</h3>
<p>
	Once you create a new theme and output it as plain CSS, place it in the styles directory 
    and include it in your project. Now you can link to it from any HTML page that contains
    Wijmo 5 controls.</p>
<pre>
&lt;link href="styles/NewTheme.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"&gt;
</pre>
