<h2>
    AngularJS Directives</h2>
<p>
    We at ComponentOne are big fans of <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>, 
    Google's framework for JavaScript applications. AngularJS provides templating, 
    data-binding, MVVM, web components, and more.</p>
<p>
    One of the main advantages of AngularJS is that it supports the MVVM pattern,
    where the application logic is contained in Models (aka controllers, implemented 
    in JavaScript) and the appearance is contained in Views (HTML).</p>
<p>
    To achieve this, AngularJS supports <b>directives</b>, which are custom HTML
    elements and attributes. AngularJS ships with a number of built-in directives,
    and you can easily implement your own much as you can create your own controls
    in WinForms or XAML applications.</p>
<p>
    Wijmo 5 ships with AngularJS directives for all its controls. The directives
    are defined in the <b>wijmo.angular.js</b> file, and allow you to write code
    such as:</p>
<pre>&lt;div ng-app="app" ng-controller="appCtrl"&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;b&gt;FlexGrid&lt;/b&gt; control:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;wj-flex-grid items-source="data"&gt;
    &lt;wj-flex-grid-column header="Country" binding="country"&gt;&lt;/wj-flex-grid-column&gt;
    &lt;wj-flex-grid-column header="Sales" binding="sales"&gt;&lt;/wj-flex-grid-column&gt;
    &lt;wj-flex-grid-column header="Expenses" binding="expenses"&gt;&lt;/wj-flex-grid-column&gt;
    &lt;wj-flex-grid-column header="Downloads" binding="downloads"&gt;&lt;/wj-flex-grid-column&gt;
&lt;/wj-flex-grid&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<h3>
    Using Wijmo 5 in an AngularJS Application</h3>
<p>
    If you want to use Wijmo 5 Angular directives in your project, add references first
    to jQuery, then to AngularJS, Wijmo, and Wijmo's AngularJS directives. Once you have
    these references in place, tell AngularJS that your app depends on the "wj" module
    using code like this:</p>
<pre>var app = angular.module('app', ['wj']);</pre>
<p>
    With the app defined, you can go on to add a controller to provide data and logic as you 
    would with any AngularJS application.</p>
<p>
    All Wijmo 5 directives start with the "wj" prefix, followed by the control's class name
    using dashes instead of camel-case. The directives have attributes that match the 
    control's properties, following the same convention.</p>
<p>
    Some of the directives support nested sub-directives. For example, the <b>wj-flex-grid</b>
    directive may contain one or more <b>wj-flex-grid-column</b> directives, and the  
    <b>wj-flex-chart</b> directive may contain one or more <b>wj-flex-chart-series</b>
    directives. This results in a rich and expressive markup syntax that is very similar
    to XAML. This flexibility is essential in order to achieve the true benefits of MVVM. 
    The appearance and layout of the controls are defined by the view; the controller only 
    provides the data.</p>
