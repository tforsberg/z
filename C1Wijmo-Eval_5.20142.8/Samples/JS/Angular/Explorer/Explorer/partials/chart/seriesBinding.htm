            Chart series binding</h3>
        <p>
            This view shows how you can use the <b>FlexChart</b> to show data from
            multiple data sources, one per series.</p>
        <p>
            The sample does the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Set the chart's <b>bindingX</b> and <b>binding</b> properties to "x" and "y".</li>
            <li>
                Add a <b>Series</b> object to the chart's <b>series</b> array and set its
                <b>itemsSource</b> property to an array of objects that have "x" and "y" properties.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a second <b>Series</b> object to the chart's <b>series</b> array and set its
                <b>itemsSource</b> property to a different array of objects that have "x" and "y" 
                properties.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Alternatively, we could have set the <b>bindingX</b> and <b>binding</b> properties on the
            <b>Series</b> objects instead of setting then on the chart. In this case this was not necessary
            because the binding names are the same for all series.</p>
