			Unbound
		</h3>
		<p>
			All versions of the <b>FlexGrid</b> support an unbound mode, where you add rows and
			columns in code and the grid stores the data itself (there's no external data source).
		</p>
		<p>
			This sample shows how you can create and populate extra header rows, and how you
			can assign arbitrary (unbound) data to grid cells.
