            Bubble</h3>

            This view shows how to create bubble charts using the <b>FlexChart</b> control.</p>
        <p>
            Bubble charts are similar to other chart types, except in addition to X and Y you must
            specify a binding for the bubble size. This is done by setting the <b>binding</b> property
            to a comma-delimited string that specifies the name of the properties to be used for the
            Y and size values for each bubble.</p>
        <p>
            In this example, the chart is bound to a list containing objects with "x", "y", and "size"
            properties. The chart contains a single series and its <b>binding</b> property is set to
            the string "y,size".</p>
