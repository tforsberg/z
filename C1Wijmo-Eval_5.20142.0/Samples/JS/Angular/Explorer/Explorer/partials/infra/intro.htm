		<h3>
			Introduction</h3>
		<p>
			This new version of Wijmo was re-written from scratch.
			We decided it was time to take full advantage of the latest technologies and
			launch a pure HTML5/JavaScript product, no longer making compromises in order
			to support legacy browsers.</p>
		<p>
			We also decided to leverage our experience in control development and
			implement some .NET tried-and-true concepts including the <b>ICollectionView</b>
			interface, event patterns, and control templates.</p>
		<p>
			This application highlights some of the main features in Wijmo 5. If you want
			to learn more about the details, feel free to check the
			<a href="http://wijmo.com/5/docs/" target="_blank">on-line documentation</a>.</p>
