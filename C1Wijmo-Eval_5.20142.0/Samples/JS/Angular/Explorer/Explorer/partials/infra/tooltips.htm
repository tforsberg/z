			Tooltips</h3>
		<p>
			Wijmo provides a 
            <a href="http://wijmo.com/5/docs/topic/wijmo.Tooltip.Class.html" target="_blank">
            Tooltip</a> class that allows you to add tooltips to any element on the page.</p>
		<p>
			You can use the Tooltip class in two modes:</p>
		<p>
			<b>Automatic Mode:</b> Use the <b>setTooltip</b> method to connect the 
            Tooltip to one or more elements on the page. The Tooltip automatically 
            monitors events and displays the tooltips when the user performs 
            actions that trigger the tooltip. For example:</p>
		<pre>// create the tooltip object
var tt = new wijmo.Tooltip();
// associate the tooltip with one or more controls
tt.setTooltip('#menu', 'Select commands.');
tt.setTooltip('#tree', 'Explore the hierarchy.');
tt.setTooltip('#chart', '#idChartTooltip');</pre>
		<p>
			<b>Manual Mode:</b> The caller is responsible for showing and hiding the 
            tooltip using the <b>show</b> and <b>hide</b> methods. For example:
		</p>
		<pre>// create the tooltip object
var tt = new wijmo.Tooltip();
// show the tooltip when the user clicks an element
element.addEventListener('click', function () {
  if (tt.isVisible) {
    tt.hide();
  } else {
    tt.show(element, 'Thanks for clicking this important element!');
  }
});</pre>

	<h4>
		Automatic Tooltips</h4>
	<p>
		The paragraph below has some automatic tooltips:</p>
	<p>
		We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, 
        that they are endowed by their
		<span wj-tooltip="#ttCreator">Creator</span> with certain unalienable
		<span wj-tooltip="#ttRight">Rights</span>, that among these are
		<span wj-tooltip="#ttLife">Life</span>, <span wj-tooltip="#ttLiberty">Liberty</span>,
		and the pursuit of <span wj-tooltip="#ttHappiness">Happiness</span>.
		-- That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, 
        deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, -- That 
        whenever any Form of <span wj-tooltip="#ttGovernment">Government</span> 
        becomes destructive of these ends, it is the 
        <span wj-tooltip="#ttRight">Right</span> of the
		<span wj-tooltip="#ttPeople">People</span> to alter or to abolish it, and 
        to institute new <span wj-tooltip="#ttGovernment">Government</span>, 
        laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in 
        such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their
		<span wj-tooltip="#ttSafety">Safety</span> and
		<span wj-tooltip="#ttHappiness">Happiness</span>.</p>

	<h4>
		Custom Tooltips</h4>
	<p>
		In some cases you may want to display dynamic information about an element. 
        There are several ways to do this:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			You can call the <b>setTooltip</b> method to update the tooltip content 
            for an element. This approach is a good choice if the information doesn't 
            change often.</li>
		<li>
			You can handle the <b>popup</b> event to update the tooltip content before 
            it is shown to the user.</li>
		<li>
			Or you can call the <b>show</b> and <b>hide</b> methods at any time and 
            completely customize what is shown to the user and when. You can also 
            specify the area within the control that the tooltip refers to (e.g. a 
            grid cell or a chart data point).</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The grid below illustrates the last approach. The controller handles the grid's
		<b>mousemove</b> event and shows a tooltip with information about the cell
		under the mouse.</p>
	<wj-flex-grid 
        style="height:300px"
		control="ctx.flex"
		items-source="ctx.data">
	</wj-flex-grid>
</div>
