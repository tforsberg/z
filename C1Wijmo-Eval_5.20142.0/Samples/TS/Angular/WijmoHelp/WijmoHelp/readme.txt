WijmoHelp
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the Wijmo 5 help system.

This project uses AngularJS and a set of topic files produced automatically from the
Wijmo5 source code to generate an on-line help system.

The project uses html5Mode routing to support URLs without hash symbols. This is 
important because it allows search engines to index the whole site.

In order to support html5Mode routing, you have add a <base> element to the main 
HTML page and make adjustments to the web.config file. For more details, see the
comments in the source code.

The help system uses a Google custom search engine to perform searches. For more
